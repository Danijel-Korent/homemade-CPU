# homemade-CPU
Designing CPU for fun. A simple 8-bit harvard architecture with 12-bit instructions, 8-bit datapath, 2x8-bit input register and 2x8bit output interface. Connected to the TTY and keyboard with a simple interactive "shell-like" program loaded into ROM. Currently has 13 instructions that were the bare minimum to implement the "shell-like" program. There is a room in instruction decoder for 3 more instruction, which a may or may not add in the future.

# How to use it
The CPU is designed and simulated with a digital design tool called Logisim:
